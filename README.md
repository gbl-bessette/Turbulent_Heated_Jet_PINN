# Turbulent_Heated_Jet_PINN
This repository includes all the scripts used for the Sci-ML model inference of velocity and pressure components of a 3D turbulent heated jet from its temperature field. 
The data can be found under the Data folder. Codes are listed in the Scripts directory and an example of results is stored in the Results folder. 

Simulations can be run with the main script under PINN_main.py which calls all other codes.
